General Adventure Game Ideas
1. Goals and Sub-Goals

Personal and External Goals: The player starts with their own goals and can later choose new goals or receive (be forced into) goals from characters in the game.

Types of Sub-Goals:

Simple sub-goals only require the player’s innate skills or attributes.

Complex sub-goals require 1–3 specific assets or events. The player is informed of these requirements in a contextual frame, e.g., via UI icons or text messages.

Progression and Flags: Some sub-goals can only be activated once earlier ones are completed. These “flags” open new opportunities and create a dynamic story.

2. Attributes and Resource Impact

Changing Abilities: Abilities and character attributes can be enhanced or altered through special sub-goals, or temporarily changed via equipment bonuses. Abilities are usually measured from 1–100%. Many challenges have a success rate of around 50%, which can be increased with a relevant ability. For example, a 50% ability can raise a chance from 50% to 75%.

Inventory Limits: The player can carry several assets, but only one per hand, one type of armor, etc. This forces tactical choices about which items to use actively. Some items require both hands, while others cannot be used in the off-hand.

Trading: Some characters buy and sell specific things with a profit margin. This margin can sometimes be reduced via a relevant ability.

3. Areas, Locations, and Categories

Areas and Starting Locations: Each region has a starting location where the player meets local characters, sees known places, and available actions.

Discovering Locations: The player can visit all known places in an area or uncover new ones by exploring or asking NPCs.

Categorization: Places, assets, and characters are tagged with one or more categories (labels), making it easy to search and filter information.

4. Travel and Reputation

Time Cost of Travel: Moving between places consumes time and results in a small exponential decrease in reputation (standard: 1% per day, calculated via an exponential function).

Time and Resource Pressure: The time limit motivates the player to prioritize travel and activities.

Reputation Mechanics:

Exchange: Asking NPCs for information costs a portion of reputation if the answer is useful.

Reward: Sharing knowledge or completing sub-goals increases reputation.

Significance: Reputation functions as respect, showing that the player can make things happen.

5. Social Dynamics: Factions and Relations

Faction Membership: Characters belong to factions with different interrelations. The player influences their standing with each faction through their actions.

Consequences: In serious conflicts, NPCs may call on stronger faction members. Not all will attack directly, but situations may escalate. The player must balance social interactions.

6. Protagonist Switching and Genre Reskin

Switching Protagonists: The player may choose to switch protagonists and use different abilities/resources.
